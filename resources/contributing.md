## Code of Conduct

We take our open source community seriously and hold ourselves and other contributors to high standards of communication. By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md).

## Getting Started
If you have never contributed to an open source project, following resources may help you get started:
* [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
* [Guide on how to contribute to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#how-to-submit-a-contribution)
* [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the code, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
<br /> If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one.

### Pull Requests

PRs to our repository are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Include documentation in the repo.

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the fork-and-pull git workflow:

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository so that we can efficiently review the changes.
